- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rudeus-Greyrat-00 AKA Samuele Capacci
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Godot, Gamedev, C, Python, AI, Operating Systems, would like to learn C++ at some point
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (because you never stop learning) Python, C, C#, Godot game engine
- 🖥️ I've worked on:
      - Blazor C# Framework (realized a management software for a small company)
      - C# libraries for game dialogues (in my github) just for fun
      - Embedded C software to retreive images from ONVIF compliant cameras. It was more a DEMO than other. It is not on my github, it was for the same company of before
      - Various project created during my university's course, some during my batchelor degree, some during the master degree. They are on github and they have their own         description.
      - Currently studying at University of Cagliari. I should end by 2024. This is the course « https://www.unica.it/unica/en/crs_70_90.page »
