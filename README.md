- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rudeus-Greyrat-00 AKA Samuele Capacci
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Godot, Gamedev, C, Python, AI, Operating Systems, would like to learn C++ at some point
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (because you never stop learning I guess): Python, C, C#, Godot Game engine
- 🖥️ I've worked on / with:
  - Blazor C# Framework (realized a management software for a small company during an internship)
  - C# libraries for game dialogues (in my github) just for fun
  - Embedded C software to retreive images from ONVIF compliant cameras. It was more a DEMO than not. It is not on my github, it was for the same company of before
  - Various project created during my university's course, some during my batchelor degree, some during the master degree. They are on github and they have their own description.
  - I have some experience with the Godot Game engine, but I've got bored every time before completing a project. I'm going to get something done sooner or later
  - I have minimal experience with Unity, I created a couple of project (a very basic FPS game for a batchelor course, and an even more basic VR experience) they are not in my github. Actually, I've probably lost the VR one
- 📙 I've studied at some point, but still not applied on any project:
  - SQL and noSQL databases, SQL query, designing of ER databases
  - Operating Systems, process management in Linux, inter-process communication, pipes, system calls, still studying this at the time I'm writing this
  - Assembly MIPS
  - Some internet and networking concept. I've used Cisco Packet Tracer for a bit, setting router and switch that use Cisco IOS operating system
  - Some AI concepts, will update when the course will be finished
  - Still learning new stuff
