- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rudeus-Greyrat-00 AKA Samuele Capacci
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Godot, Gamedev, C, Python, AI, Operating Systems, would like to learn C++ at some point
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (because you never stop learning I guess): Python, C, C#, Godot Game engine, and a lot of other less specific topics. See "About me:"
- 🖥️ I've worked on / with:
  - Blazor C# Framework (realized a management software for a small company during an internship)
  - C# libraries for game dialogues (in my github) just for fun. I used the WPF framework to create the editor
  - Embedded C software to retreive images from ONVIF compliant cameras. It was more a DEMO than not. It is not on my github, it was for the same company of before
  - Various project created during my university's course, some during my batchelor degree, some during the master degree. They are on github and they have their own description.
  - I have some experience with the Godot Game engine, but I've got bored every time before completing a project. I'm going to get something done sooner or later
  - I have minimal experience with Unity, I created a couple of project (a very basic FPS game for a batchelor course, and an even more basic VR experience) they are not in my github. Actually, I've probably lost the VR one
- 📙 I've studied at some point, but still not applied on any project:
  - SQL and noSQL databases, SQL query, designing of ER databases
  - Operating Systems, process management in Linux, inter-process communication, pipes, system calls, still studying this at the time I'm writing this
  - Assembly MIPS
  - Some internet and networking concept. I've used Cisco Packet Tracer for a bit, setting router and switch that use Cisco IOS operating system (inside cisco packet tracer)
  - Some AI concepts, will update when the course will be finished
  - Still learning new stuff

 - 👨🏻‍💻About me:
   - Graduate in Informatics Engineering at University of Cagliari. Actually the degree's name was "Electric, Electronic, Informatics Engineering", but it was more focused on the informatics part
   - Currently studying at University of Cagliari. I should end by 2024. This is the (master) course « https://www.unica.it/unica/en/crs_70_90.page »
   - Currently living / studying in italy. I can speak Italian (native language) and English (B2)
   - Born on 12/06/2000 (not sure if this info is useful at all)
   - At the moment you can't find me in any social network, and for the best, yeah it's definetely better to keep reddit and discord separated from work, isn't it?
   - Yeah, I know that my profile pic is low res. No, I'm not going to do anything to address the problem
